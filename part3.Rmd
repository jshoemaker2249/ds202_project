- Is there any similar point among the gold medal earners(For example, relationships with cities, height, weight.)?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
Athlete <- read.csv(file = "athlete_events.csv")
head(Athlete)

gold <- Athlete %>% filter(Medal == "Gold") %>% select(Name,Sex,Age,Height,Weight,Sport)
head(gold)

ggplot(gold %>% na.omit(), aes(x=`Weight`, y=`Height`, color = `Sex`, size = `Age`,group = `Sport` )) + lims(x=c(20,175),y=c(120,230))+ geom_vline(xintercept = 97.5) + geom_hline(yintercept = 175)+geom_point(position='jitter')+ theme(text = element_text(size=8)) +ggtitle("Gold medal earners")+xlab("Weight")+ylab("Height") + theme(legend.position="bottom")+ facet_wrap(~Sport)
```
