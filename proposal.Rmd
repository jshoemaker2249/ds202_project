Dataset: Olympic History: Athletes and Results

Link to dataset: [link](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)

Overview of dataset: This dataset, of 16 columns, contains basic information about the past 120 years of Olympic Games. Columns range from athlete name and information, event, year, medal, and location.


Exploratory Analysis Plan: From this dataset, we hope to examine the relationship between athletes and their respective performance. Questions we could potentially investigate?

- Which particular country produces the most gold medalists for any given sport?
- Is there evidence of the Russian Doping Scandal in this dataset?
